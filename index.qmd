I currently hold the Acadiana Business Economist/BORSF Eminent Scholar Endowed Chair in Economics position at the University of Louisiana. In this role, I monitor the region's economic environment, conduct research and analysis, and develop and maintain external stakeholder relationships on behalf of the Moody College of Business and University.

My research interests range from regional economics to state and local public finance issues, with a particular focus on fiscal institutions and place-based economic development. I am also Editor-in-Chief of [_Public Finance Review_](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pfr) and Co-Editor of [_Contemporary Economic Policy_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657287).

Prior to joining the University of Louisiana in 2018, I was (most recently) Vice-President & Senior Regional Officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
